An agentic AI dashboard designed to be a teacher's digital assistant. This tool leverages a team of AI agents to automate administrative tasks, generate educational content, and provide data-driven insights, freeing up teachers to focus on what they do best: teaching.

## 🤔 How It Works

This isn't just a single AI model. **AI Teacher Helper** uses an **agentic framework**. Think of it like a team of specialized AI assistants working together:

1.  **Planner Agent:** Takes your request and breaks it down into smaller, manageable steps.
2.  **Content Agent:** Researches the topic and generates the core educational material.
3.  **Critique Agent:** Reviews the generated content for accuracy, clarity, and age-appropriateness.
4.  **Formatter Agent:** Takes the final content and formats it into a clean, downloadable document (e.g., PDF, DOCX).

This multi-agent approach ensures higher quality, more reliable, and more nuanced results than a single-prompt model.
